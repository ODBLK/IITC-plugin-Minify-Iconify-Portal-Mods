# Minify & Iconify Portal Mods

This IITC-CE plugin adds a toggleable display mode to the portal mod slots:

* **Full Mode**: Displays full icon graphics for each mod (using images from ameba64/ingress-items).
* **Mini Mode**: Shows compact text abbreviations like `HS [VR]`, with rarity-based color highlights.
* The toggle is activated by clicking on the mod bar.
* The selected view mode is remembered across sessions.

## Features

* ðŸ“¦ **Icon mode** with high-quality SVGs.
* ðŸ§© **Text mode** with abbreviations and rarity tags.
* ðŸŽ¨ Text color and border dynamically match mod rarity via IITC's `COLORS_MOD`.
* âš¡ Preloads mod icons for faster switching.
* ðŸ§  Intelligent caching using `localStorage`.
